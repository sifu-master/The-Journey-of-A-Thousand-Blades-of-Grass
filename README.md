## It All Starts Here

Hey there Grasshopper - sifu has come through for you. Here I've lit the path that will lead you to the kawaii Otaku girls of your dreams. It won't be an easy road, that's for damn sure, but if you put in the work, brave through the sweat and the blood, and trust in sifu, then you'll soon join sifu in infinite enlightenment. And make a fuck ton of 💰💰💰💰 too.

So, let's begin grasshopper...

## How To Use

The path is not a linear one. But there definitely is an order. You start by going through the `Setup` section. Make sure that you have your computer set up and you have the tools and software necessary first. Start with these and get accustomed to this new world.

Now, after you've gotten set up, it's time for your warmup. You've got to limber up and review the basics of HTML / CSS / and Javascript before testing your blade. So go through the Udemy Course I've linked you to that will go over all the basic concepts and put them in practice. See where you're at and refresh. Go at your own pace and skip through what you already know or what comes back to you.

If you feel that you need to go through the whole course - then do it. Everything is in that one course that you will ever need to know to get a job, freelance, and teach. So take your time and master the concepts there before moving on. It won't be as pretty as the cutting edge stuff that comes later in this guide, but you must achieve balance above all else.

After the first course is a whirlwind tour of React. This is the library that you will be using for just about everything else in this guide. It's a lot to learn, so take your time with the introduction. There is also a huge Udemy course listed in the references that goes into every aspect of React in crazy detail. It will start to make a lot more sense as you put things into practice.

Now, after your warmup, you will learn the first form of your blade. The tutorial I provided in this section shows you how to create a modern interactive portfolio site using the best tools available. While this project's 3D render isn't the most sophisticated, it is the workflow that matters and opening your mind to the possibilities. So go through and follow along with every step of the tutorial. Then, as you go through, find ways to make the project your own. Experiment, create, push and challenge yourself, and make it art. You will learn a thousand lifetimes more by experimenting and listening to your own voice than blindly following orders.

If you are able to master the first form of your blade, then now you can get serious. The next project is one that takes all that you learned and adds in databases, authentication, payments, and more. Working for the high paying clients, you will be able to charge exponentially more once you've mastered the entirety of the stack. This will take a long time - but at the end you can make any application that you imagine. And get those dollars along the way.

Those two projects are the core. But you should also train and build out more creative, artistic examples. There are many available on Youtube and across the web, but thsee are a taste of what you can do. Go through them in order and work your way up to learning more and more about the technology. These will take you from amateur to professional and unlock the power available in the palm of your hands.

You should also work on solving CodeWars problems every day. These are your kata. They are your tactics like in chess. You will learn to think like a programmer and find solutions to any problem out there. You will hone your mind and deepen your wisdom. There is a link to a Udemy algorithms course that will go over the most common ones and show you how to approach these problems. Watch a few sections and then attempt to solve the 8 and 7 kyu problems regularly. Then challenge yourself and really think you to use your new skills to solve the harder and harder problems. We both know you can do that.

Lastly, there are sections for inspiration and references for the technology used. You should use these to drive your own projects and to come back to when you need to review concepts and examples. Spend time with these and especially go through the references to make sure you're understanding and that you're not left behind on anything that the other proejcts go over. And sifu will always be available as well.

And lastly lastly - enjoy and take the time to appreciate how far you've come and how much you'll be able to experience. You've earned it 🇯🇵🗻👧🏻
